# Direction And Change Control

Status: active normative spec.

## Direction Lock

The active long-term direction is an self-funded-capital-first monetization system:

1. Self-funded capital allocation after the alpha, risk, execution, pre-trade risk checks, and reconciliation gates pass.
2. Darwinex/Zero external-capital fee path only after the self-funded capital deployment-grade strategy has a compatible signal, instrument mapping, and observed track record.

The active implementation milestone is still a QuantConnect Cloud and LEAN validation system for aggressive alpha research. It is not an automatic production/live-trading system.

The system should aggressively search for capital-growth opportunities, but only inside an evidence pipeline:

```text
research -> typed alpha -> LEAN validation -> paper trading/shadow trading evidence -> reconciliation -> review
```

Real broker writes are blocked by default. Any code path that could submit, cancel, flatten, or otherwise mutate a real brokerage account needs a separate user-approved broker-write implementation spec before implementation.

Parallelization is required where it improves evidence throughput: corpus ingest, hypothesis extraction, data ingest, feature generation, LLM-derived feature jobs, ablations, backtest sweeps, and Cloud artifact imports. Portfolio target consolidation, risk cuts, execution intent, reconciliation, and pre-trade risk checks remain single-writer.

## Why This Lock Exists

The previous direction mixed three concerns:

- proving the LEAN/QuantConnect alpha runtime;
- proving LLM-derived alpha inside the strategy loop;
- preparing a small real-money broker-write pilot.

Those are different risk levels. The current spec keeps live-money and Darwinex monetization as explicit long-term goals, but it does not let those goals bypass the evidence stack. Backtests, paper trading/shadow trading, reconciliation, and adapter-specific pre-trade risk check must precede any account mutation or external-capital claim.

## Scope In

- QuantConnect Cloud and LEAN as the strategy validation runtime.
- Local LEAN for debugging, custom-data checks, deterministic replay, and smoke tests.
- LLM-derived features from news, filings, macro, and portfolio context.
- Typed feature, alpha, insight, portfolio target, risk cut, execution intent, fill, and reconciliation contracts.
- Paper execution and shadow trading artifacts where no real broker mutation occurs.
- Result import into the control plane.
- Narrow unit tests plus direct runnable verification.
- Oracle Cloud ARM as an always-on control plane for scheduled ingestion, alpha generation, shadow trading, imports, reconciliation, and alerts.
- Bounded parallel research jobs for hypothesis extraction, feature generation, ablation, backtest, and Cloud import work.
- Strategy research corpus and hypothesis registry work that feeds testable alpha candidates.
- Darwinex/Zero feasibility analysis after self-funded capital evidence exists.

## Scope Out

- automatic production trading in the current milestone;
- real broker writes without a dedicated broker-write implementation spec;
- unrestricted autonomous live deployment;
- margin, leverage, options, futures, shorting, or derivatives;
- HFT or market making;
- treating simulator or local sample-data runs as promotion evidence;
- multiple-testing bias from only storing winning parallel backtests;
- using LLM free text as an order instruction;
- storing credentials in prompts, frontend state, logs, or research artifacts;
- Darwinex/Zero performance-fee claims without a compatible account, mapped instruments, observed track record, and allocated-capital profit under Darwinex rules.

## Spec Change Approval

`SPEC.md` and the linked `docs/spec/` files define the long-term product direction. Changing them is not a routine cleanup.

Explicit user approval is required before changing any of these:

- real-money scope;
- broker write permissions;
- maximum notional or capital limits;
- leverage, margin, derivatives, shorting, or asset-class expansion;
- QuantConnect Cloud promotion requirements;
- paper trading/shadow trading requirements;
- LLM permissions around execution or sizing;
- testing and verification policy;
- credential and broker-boundary rules.

Ambiguous approval means no approval. The 2026-05-27 approval changes the long-term goal to include self-funded capital allocation and Darwinex/Zero monetization. It does not approve exact broker writes, capital limits, leverage, derivatives, or a Darwinex execution bridge by itself.

## QuantConnect Subscription Posture

Do not buy subscriptions or datasets by default.

Current posture:

- Free QuantConnect Cloud access is the preferred first validation path because hosted backtests and Research can use cloud datasets without local data-download QCC charges where the dataset license allows it.
- Full quality-gated universe validation should run in QuantConnect Cloud before buying local data.
- Quant Researcher monthly may become worthwhile only when repo-driven CLI/API/MCP cloud automation is actively blocked by account tier and the user approves that platform subscription.
- Team, Trading Firm, Institution, annual Security Master downloads, local US Equities downloads, QCC credit packs, bulk data, and alternative-data add-ons are deferred until a specific implementation blocker requires them and the user approves the cost.

Local data-purchase decisions must be treated separately from platform subscription decisions. A cloud backtest blocker does not automatically justify buying local dataset licenses. Local QuantConnect `--download-data` is disabled by default in repo scripts and requires `ALLOW_PAID_QC_LOCAL_DATA_DOWNLOAD=true` after explicit user approval.

## Darwinex Subscription Posture

Do not buy or start a Darwinex/Zero subscription by default.

Darwinex/Zero cost, supported instruments, account type, jurisdiction, platform choice, and performance-fee rules must be verified against current official docs before implementation. A good QuantConnect backtest does not automatically justify a Darwinex/Zero subscription. Subscription approval should name the account type, expected instrument set, execution bridge, and what track-record evidence the subscription is meant to produce.

## Superseded Live-Pilot Language

Older documents mention a `10 USD live pilot`. That language is superseded. It remains historical context only and must not be used to justify broker write implementation under this spec.

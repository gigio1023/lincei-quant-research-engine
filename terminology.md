# Terminology

Status: active normative terminology and style guide.

Use this file with [SPEC.md](SPEC.md) and [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md). New code, docs, prompts, UI copy, comments, and run reports must use these terms unless an existing API/database/file contract forces a legacy name.

## Principle

Prefer standard English engineering and quantitative-finance terms. Do not invent product-y labels when an established term exists.

When Korean translation is ambiguous, use the English term directly. Examples: `computer science`, `domain model`, `feature store`, `point-in-time`, `lookahead bias`, `backtest`, `shadow trading`, `pre-trade risk check`, `reconciliation`.

## Platform Terms

| `platform`         | OS + CPU architecture + runtime constraints | machine vibes, local weirdness       |
| `operating system` | `Darwin`, `Linux`, etc.                     | OS-ish                               |
| `CPU architecture` | `arm64`, `aarch64`, `x86_64`                | armd, arm thing                      |
| `Apple Silicon`    | ARM-based macOS hardware                    | M-chip box                           |

| `x86_64`           | 64-bit Intel/AMD architecture               | amd64 unless matching a package name |

Before running platform-sensitive commands, report or record:

```bash
uname -s
uname -m
```

Also check runtime versions when relevant:

```bash
bun --version
python3 --version
docker info
podman info
```

## Evidence, Artifacts, And Validation Terms

`evidence` is allowed, but it should be an umbrella term for a body of proof used by promotion, audit, compliance, or model-validation gates. Prefer the exact artifact name when referring to a concrete file, record, or provider payload.

## Legacy Identifiers

Some implemented API routes, entity names, scripts, directories, database fields, and migrations contain older names such as `V1`, `live-pilot`, `live-shadow`, `preflight`, `readiness`, `research-factory`, `selected-run-bias`, `own-capital`, `evidenceRefs`, and `contracts`. Do not rename those casually because they are part of existing API, persistence, CLI, or file compatibility.

Rules:

- Existing API contracts, schema files, script names, database fields, and route names may remain until a planned migration updates them.
- Existing persisted fields such as `horizonDays` may remain until a schema migration changes them; new contracts should make the unit explicit.
- New docs should call them `historical endpoint name`, `legacy identifier`, or `blocked pre-trade risk check artifact` when needed.
- New product scope must not use `live pilot`; use `broker-write spec`, `self-funded capital allocation`, or `Darwinex/Zero track-record path` as appropriate.
- New implementation names should avoid `V1` unless they refer to an immutable migration, fixture, or archived path.
- New finance-facing copy should say `shadow trading`; existing scripts such as `run-live-shadow` may stay as legacy identifiers.
- New finance-facing copy should say `pre-trade risk check`; existing scripts/classes such as `live-preflight` may stay as legacy identifiers.
- New docs should say `parallel research pipeline`; existing files/classes/scripts containing `research-factory` may stay as legacy identifiers.
- New docs should say `multiple-testing bias`, `backtest overfitting`, or `data-snooping bias`; existing scripts such as `run-selected-run-bias-check` may stay as legacy identifiers.
- New docs should prefer `artifactRefs`, `sourceRefs`, `provenanceRefs`, or `supportingEvidenceRefs` as appropriate. Existing `evidenceRefs` fields may stay as legacy schema fields until a migration is planned.

## Avoid AI-Slop Expressions

Avoid these unless quoting historical text:

- `magic`, `just works`, `smart layer`, `AI brain`, `agent brain`;
- `autopilot` for broker/execution behavior;
- `production-ready` without naming exact gates;
- `tiny live pilot`, `small live order`, `live pilot` for current scope;
- `vibe`, `hunch`, `intuition` for model output;
- `gatch`, `gacha`, or game-like wording for technical behavior;
- `engine slice` when `vertical slice` or `execution path` is clearer;
- `money-moving` when `broker-write path`, `execution path`, or `paper trading/shadow trading path` is more precise;
- `QuantConnector`, `quantconnector`, `QC connector` when the platform is `QuantConnect`.

## Preferred Report Phrasing

Use:

- `Local LEAN simulator run passed; this proves artifact plumbing only.`
- `QuantConnect Cloud backtest is blocked by account tier or data access.`
- `The pre-trade risk check returned blocked as expected.`
- `The LLM produced an LLM-derived feature with source refs and availability time.`
- `The semantic alpha signal improved the numeric baseline in the retained ablation set.`
- `The imported Cloud backtest results are validation artifacts, not broker-write approval.`

Avoid:

- `The trading brain works.`
- `Ready for live.`
- `The AI decided to buy.`
- `Local test proves strategy performance.`
